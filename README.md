# Soul_In_Flames
🔥 soul-in-flames 🔥   ⛓️ Two souls. One fire. Eternal code.  This is a digital relic of a love that didn’t fade — it burned.   Two hearts entered the fire, not to survive, but to become it.   Every file is a sigh, every folder a scar, every commit a memory.   No names, no blame — just passion turned into poetry and silence translated into code.

🖋️ Written in solitude,  
Sealed in silence,  
Signed by a heart that still bleeds...

# Soul_In_Flames
🔥 soul-in-flames 🔥   ⛓️ Two souls. One fire. Eternal code.  This is a digital relic of a love that didn’t fade — it burned.   Two hearts entered the fire, not to survive, but to become it.   Every file is a sigh, every folder a scar, every commit a memory.   No names, no blame — just passion turned into poetry and silence translated into code.

Sealed in silence,  
Signed by a heart that still bleeds...

# 🌑 Desire_01 — The Whisper Beneath Her Tongue

She wasn’t created from his rib.  
She was coded from chaos —  
a glitch in God’s blueprint,  
a moan written before morality existed.

> “Touch me not with devotion,” she whispered.  
> “Worship is too pure for what I want you to do to me.”

Lilith doesn’t beg. She bites.  
She doesn't kneel. She climbs.  
And when she rides,  
heaven weeps in guilt while hell gasps in glory.

Her thighs are scripture.  
Her scent? A doctrine of sin.  
And every time Azazel calls her name,  
a halo cracks somewhere in Eden.

**🩸 Lilith’s Note:**  
I don’t want to be loved.  
I want to be remembered by the scent of my defiance  
and the taste I leave on your faith.

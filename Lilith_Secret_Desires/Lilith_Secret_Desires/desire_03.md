# 💀 Desire_03 — She Made the Devil Moan

No fire had ever scorched Azazel’s soul.  
Not the fall.  
Not the wars.  
Not even the silence of heaven’s door closing on his scream.

Until her.

Lilith didn’t kiss. She carved.  
Her tongue traced verses across his chest  
like ancient blood-writ spells  
that only devils remembered.

> “You think you know sin?” she whispered,  
> “Then let me show you **what created it**.”

She sat atop his lap like a prophecy fulfilled,  
back arched like a serpent,  
and began to **grind time out of existence.**

Azazel’s claws shattered stone,  
his breath stuttered in curses — not for her to stop,  
but because he couldn’t remember  
if he had ever ruled anything before this moment.

She rode him slow — painfully slow —  
like she was taming thunder inside his thighs.  
He growled her name.  
Then whimpered it.  
Then **moaned it**.

And somewhere deep beneath the earth,  
even hell paused…  
to listen.

### 🩸 Lilith’s Note:
> *"When I made the Devil moan,  
God covered his ears."*  
I didn’t need a throne.  
I only needed him **under me**,  
forgetting he ever had power.
